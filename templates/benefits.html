            iron in the body. This excess of iron may be inherited or be caused due to alcoholism, anemia and other

            reducing risk of heart and liver problems caused by excess of iron in the body. Though iron is important for
            the body but as excess of everything is bad, excess of iron gets stored in heart, liver and pancreas. This
            leads to accelerated ageing, heart attacks and risk of liver failure. Blood donation maintains the iron
            levels and reduces the risk of many health problems.</h3>

            blood you donate is separated into a variety of components as per the needs of patients. Each component can
            be used for different purpose. As the blood requirements of newborns are small, many can be benefitted by a
